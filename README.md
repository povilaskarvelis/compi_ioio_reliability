This repository contains the code for reproducing the results in Karvelis et al. (2024) "Test-retest reliability of behavioral and computational measures of advice taking under volatility"

Use the master script compi_master_ioio_test_retest.m as your starting point. Everything else is explained in the code itself.

Some things to note:
1) Specify your local directories for data and code in compi_ioio_options.m
2) Once you run the master script, run compi_test_retest_reliability_plots.R in R, which will generate plots for the main test-retest reliability results.
