function c = tapas_hgf_config
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Contains the configuration for the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)
% for continuous inputs.
%
% The HGF is the model introduced in 
%
% Mathys C, Daunizeau J, Friston, KJ, and Stephan KE. (2011). A Bayesian foundation
% for individual learning under uncertainty. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 5:39.
%
% This file refers to CONTINUOUS inputs (Eqs 48ff in Mathys et al., (2011));

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The HGF configuration consists of the priors of parameters and initial values. All priors are
% Gaussian in the space where the quantity they refer to is estimated. They are specified by their
% sufficient statistics: mean and variance (NOT standard deviation).
% 
% Quantities are estimated in their native space if they are unbounded (e.g., the omegas). They are
% estimated in log-space if they have a natural lower bound at zero (e.g., the sigmas).
% 
% The kappas (and theta) are estimated in 'logit-space' because bounding them above (in addition to
% their natural lower bound at zero) is an effective means of preventing the exploration of
% parameter regions where the assumptions underlying the variational inversion (cf. Mathys et
% al., 2011) no longer hold.
% 
% 'Logit-space' is a logistic sigmoid transformation of native space with a variable upper bound
% a>0:
% 
% tapas_logit(x) = ln(x/(a-x)); x = a/(1+exp(-tapas_logit(x)))
%
% Parameters can be fixed (i.e., set to a fixed value) by setting the variance of their prior to
% zero. Aside from being useful for model comparison, the need for this arises whenever the scale
% and origin at the j-th level are arbitrary. This is the case if the observation model does not
% contain the representations mu_j and sigma_j. A choice of scale and origin is then implied by
% fixing the initial value mu_j_0 of mu_j and either kappa_j-1 or omega_j-1.
%
% The kappas and theta can be fixed to an arbitrary value by setting the upper bound to twice that
% value and the mean as well as the variance of the prior to zero (this follows immediately from
% the logit transform above).
% 
% Fitted trajectories can be plotted by using the command
%
% >> tapas_hgf_plotTraj(est)
% 
% where est is the stucture returned by tapas_fitModel. This structure contains the estimated
% perceptual parameters in est.p_prc and the estimated trajectories of the agent's
% representations (cf. Mathys et al., 2011). Their meanings are:
%              
%         est.p_prc.mu_0       row vector of initial values of mu (in ascending order of levels)
%         est.p_prc.sa_0       row vector of initial values of sigma (in ascending order of levels)
%         est.p_prc.rho        row vector of rhos (representing drift; in ascending order of levels)
%         est.p_prc.ka         row vector of kappas (in ascending order of levels)
%         est.p_prc.om         row vector of omegas (in ascending order of levels)
%         est.p_prc.th         theta
%         est.p_prc.al         alpha
%
%         est.traj.mu          mu (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.sa          sigma (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.muhat       prediction of mu (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.sahat       precisions of predictions (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.w           weighting factors (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.da          volatility prediction errors  (rows: trials, columns: levels)
%         est.traj.dau         input prediction error
%
% Tips:
% - When analyzing a new dataset, take your inputs u and use
%
%   >> est = tapas_fitModel([], u, 'tapas_hgf_config', 'tapas_bayes_optimal_config');
%
%   to determine the Bayes optimal perceptual parameters (given your current priors as defined in
%   this file here, so choose them wide and loose to let the inputs influence the result). You can
%   then use the optimal parameters as your new prior means for the perceptual parameters.
%
% - If you get an error saying that the prior means are in a region where model assumptions are
%   violated, or if you simply get implausible trajectories (e.g., huge jumps in any of the mus), try
%   lowering the upper bound on theta.
%
% - Alternatives are lowering the upper bounds on the kappas, if they are not fixed, or adjusting
%   the values of the kappas or omegas, if any of them are fixed.
%
% - If the negative free energy F cannot be calculated because the Hessian poses problems, look at
%   est.optim.H and fix the parameters that lead to NaNs.
%
% - Your guide to all these adjustments is the negative free energy F. Whenever F increases by at
%   least 3 across datasets, the adjustment was a good idea and can be justified by just this: F
%   increased, so you had a better model.
